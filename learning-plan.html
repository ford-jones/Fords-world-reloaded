            Good lord I don’t really know. I guess that’s partly why im doing this, as a way of giving myself some options. Ideally I would like to do something creative and self-directed. There have been times where I was able to work successfully as a freelance artist / illustrator but it never had any longevity. I think learning code will let me do that but in a way that’s integrated within an established industry so that there is some structure / procedure there to guide my time management. Freelancing as an artist was difficult because the entire thing felt like a grey area between the amount of time it takes to actually produce things and client expectation.

            I think one of my strengths when it comes to learning is my passionate and obsessive nature. I really become consumed by whatever it is I am engaging myself in. My biggest limitation is definitely my nit-pickiness. I get really caught up on the niche, micro-details sometime and can end up missing out on the bigger picture. For example with the blog challenge I ended up wasting many hours on trying to figure out a work around for autoplaying media inside google chrome and in turn was left with barely any time to fulfil the actual brief.

            I definitely would like to improve my ability to work in a team and also improve my communication skills. For my whole life I’ve been very rogue and have struggled to work in groups. I think it may be because I’m an only child so I’m far more comfortable working on my own but I would like for that to change. I also have a bit of trouble recognising and raising a flag when I need help. Often I do this too late.

            I think I would like to make my work schedule a bit more fixed. Currently I am putting in 8 hours per day but the time of day in which that starts is constantly in flux which makes it tricky to communicate with others and receive help when I need it as others may be logged out for the day and I really don’t want to end up in a position where I am relying on others help after hours.
            When things become too much for me I will reach out and seek help where I can and where it is available. I think I let my ego get in the way of that sometimes.

            I will start to call out for a second pair of eyes as soon as things start turning for the worse for me. I let it slide this week and ended up making things a lot harder and creating a lot more work for myself than I needed to.

          <em>
          I guess just a level of compassion and understanding about peoples individual situations and a professional response to navigating any technical or core issues within that individuals comfort zone. Not to say that the facilitators should adhere entirely to an individuals specific needs, it should go both ways and I think that is being carried out pretty successfully already from what I can tell.

          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things? For example you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.

            On Thursdays at 5pm i go to a weekly meeting which takes about two hours out of my day if I include travel time and also unwinding (shower, cup of tea etc).
            I also go to my grandmas house every Sunday at 6pm for a family dinner till about 10pm.
            Wednesday nights im usually completely unavailable as a I have dinner at my mums house around 6pm and then from 9pm onwards I raid-lead a group of 25 people in world of warcraft through raid instances. It’s kind of like being the digital version of a conductor of an orchestra. The people I play with come from all around the world and some of them stay up till ungodly hours of the morning to wait for me to come online so I really need to give them at least 24hours notice if that is to be canceled.
