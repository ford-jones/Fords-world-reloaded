            Hopefully something that involves coding! I think I could be one of the types of people that pick a new thing up and put another down each year but I really hope coding is something that sticks with me. It would be lame to forget all of this. Integrating it into my life and using it as a problem solving tool would be awesome.

            I think through pair coding I’ve established I’m better at navigating (breaking down the syntax, figuring out what’s going on, debugging and making sense of why things are or aren’t working) than driving (bashing in lines of code, blocking out the screen with confidence, fluidity and foresight). I think my critical thinking skills are a bit more developed than my confidence in my technical capacity but that’s gonna change.

            I think time management is still going to be a big issue for me. Even after 5 weeks I’m still finding myself having to work overtime or through the weekend to keep at a good pace and be sure that I’m understanding the new information that is coming in each week. I’ve managed to justify it itself (hopefully) by doing good work regardless but I don’t think that will fly so well in bootcamp. I think having set days and hours will be pretty abrasive for me at first but quite helpful in the long run so I look forward to it.

            I think I’ve gotten better at breaking problems down and also articulating myself when speaking. I’ve spent a lot of time speaking with my peers on discord or over the phone troubleshooting solutions and trying to make sense of the nonsense which has been a super fun interaction and experience for me.

            Not too much I’m just hoping that they are friendly, understanding open-minded people which I’m sure they are. I’m hoping there isn’t too much of a crime and punishment mentality going on or like patronising behaviour. I don’t know, I have a bit of a problem with authority figures and prefer to see my teachers as friends. I had a lot of trouble with the student-teacher dynamic in high school, that changed when I went to university but it varied with different tutors. I’m hoping bootcamp is the same I suppose or even better! Teachers == students !!!

            To be as open minded as I can and try not to get too ahead of myself, let the challenges be humbling instead of frustrating. I wanna try keep my cool, stay on top of things, take it seriously and be friendly and creative with my classmates.

            Good lord I don’t really know. I guess that’s partly why im doing this, as a way of giving myself some options. Ideally I would like to do something creative and self-directed. There have been times where I was able to work successfully as a freelance artist / illustrator but it never had any longevity. I think learning code will let me do that but in a way that’s integrated within an established industry so that there is some structure / procedure there to guide my time management. Freelancing as an artist was difficult because the entire thing felt like a grey area between the amount of time it takes to actually produce things and client expectation.

          <em>
            I think one of my strengths when it comes to learning is my passionate and obsessive nature. I really become consumed by whatever it is I am engaging myself in. My biggest limitation is definitely my nit-pickiness. I get really caught up on the niche, micro-details sometime and can end up missing out on the bigger picture. For example with the blog challenge I ended up wasting many hours on trying to figure out a work around for autoplaying media inside google chrome and in turn was left with barely any time to fulfil the actual brief.

            I definitely would like to improve my ability to work in a team and also improve my communication skills. For my whole life I’ve been very rogue and have struggled to work in groups. I think it may be because I’m an only child so I’m far more comfortable working on my own but I would like for that to change. I also have a bit of trouble recognising and raising a flag when I need help. Often I do this too late.

            I think I would like to make my work schedule a bit more fixed. Currently I am putting in 8 hours per day but the time of day in which that starts is constantly in flux which makes it tricky to communicate with others and receive help when I need it as others may be logged out for the day and I really don’t want to end up in a position where I am relying on others help after hours.
            When things become too much for me I will reach out and seek help where I can and where it is available. I think I let my ego get in the way of that sometimes.

          I guess just a level of compassion and understanding about peoples individual situations and a professional response to navigating any technical or core issues within that individuals comfort zone. Not to say that the facilitators should adhere entirely to an individuals specific needs, it should go both ways and I think that is being carried out pretty successfully already from what I can tell.

            On Thursdays at 5pm i go to a weekly meeting which takes about two hours out of my day if I include travel time and also unwinding (shower, cup of tea etc).
            I also go to my grandmas house every Sunday at 6pm for a family dinner till about 10pm.
            Wednesday nights im usually completely unavailable as a I have dinner at my mums house around 6pm and then from 9pm onwards I raid-lead a group of 25 people in world of warcraft through raid instances. It’s kind of like being the digital version of a conductor of an orchestra. The people I play with come from all around the world and some of them stay up till ungodly hours of the morning to wait for me to come online so I really need to give them at least 24hours notice if that is to be canceled.
