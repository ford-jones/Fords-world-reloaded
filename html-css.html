          The Margin:
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            Each element you see on the screen is comprised of 3 stages of positioning which are relative to one another and also their parent tag. To understand how to position anything on the screen we need to understand the difference between these 3 concepts. Working inward starting from the outside we have the margin: The margin is outer shell of the entire element, it has a top, two sides and a bottom. The measurement of each side determines the distance from the parent or sibling of the element you are trying to position. It's important to note that the default measurement of each side will be 0px; so when you first code an element into a page it will sit as close to its parent or sibling as possible. We can set the element we are working withs' distance from other elements on the page through the manipulation of the margin.

          The Border:
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            As the name implies the border is the border around the element. Similarly to the margin it can be given measurements relating to each of the four sides. These could be the width, colour, shape or dropshadow of the border. The border can be distinguished from the margin by the fact it is defined and opaque, whereas the margin is more of a transparent / invisible positioning value.
