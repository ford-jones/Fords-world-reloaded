          JAVASCRIPT DISCUSSION

        <span class="question">
          What’s an analogy that could describe javascript and its relationship to html and css.
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            They’re like 3 friends or a team each with different skills. HTML is the brains, CSS is the pretty face and JavaScript is the leader who pulls the others together and makes things happen.

        <span class="question">
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            Control flow is basically the order your computer reads code which is left to right and top to bottom. The control flow can be affected by particular functions such as loops which will cause the reader to repeat or fall back on itself a given number of times, maybe going through something like an array. I think of it like making cups of tea while you are spending a day at home completing a list of to do’s. You are systematically working through each thing in the list and achieving them, but a set number of times per day you will go back and do something you have already done again and again like make a cup of tea. In a way this is similar to how loops effect the control flow of a document.

        <span class="question">
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
          The DOM or the document object model is a tool you can access to view a model of your document live. If you go into any webpage, right click anywhere on the page and click “inspect” you will be taken into developer tools. What you are looking at is the DOM. It is every file and line of code which together make up the page you are looking at, but delivered to you in a graphic interface that allows you to look through, edit and test changes to the site live locally or even remotely if you have the permissions. It is presented in a tree like structure of parent > child >= sibling that should reflect the cohesiveness of your document or otherwise assist in checking for bugs.

          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            To understand the difference in how data is accessed from each of these elements we need to understand what the differences between these two elements actually are. 
            Firstly an array is a type of variable which within its’ parenthesis has specifically named pieces of information in quotation marks which the computer recognises as strings and assigns each a numerical value. 
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            Take this example:
          </em>
        </p>
        <img class="arrayExample" src="images/arrayExample.png" alt="array pic">
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            This line of code is an array and its’ square brackets contain 4 seperate strings. When the computer reads this piece of code it will assign each string a number starting from 0.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            so;
          </em>
          <ul>
            <li>
              - “this” equals “0”, 
            </li>
            <li>
              - “is” equals “1”, 
            </li>
            <li>
              - “an” equals “2”
            </li>
            <li>
              - “array” equals “3”.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="response">
          With this in mind, if we wanted to access a string from an array we could specify and call it from its’ numerical value and apply that number to a function such as a loop.
        </p>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            Objects are a little different. While they may be similar to an array in the sense that they are a variable with a name and parenthesis that contain data, they differ in the fact that the data of an object has no attached numerical value. Also objects allow us to specify it’s contents into a bit more detail than an array by using what is called a key. Inside the parenthesis of the object  { } we can elaborate on what is contained in our variable by giving in a name followed by a colon : and then a value which could be a string, a numerical or the culmination of other elements joined together with operators.

              You see we have `let` which is declaring that this thing indeed does exist, it is made up of two components which each have the different values of ‘1’ and ‘2’.
This information has now been stored and we can access it whenever we need by first naming the object itself followed by a fullstop ‘.’ and then naming a piece of information from the key.

              Now if we open Dev tools and check the console log we will see the number 3, which has been made from accessing the key of an object we made earlier. See below.
