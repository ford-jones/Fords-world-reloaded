                If we understand the principles of neuroplasticity we can then understand our brain’s as maluable objects. Our brains physical structure changes as we learn, think and conceptualise new ideas. Learning about neuroplasticity can teach people that their ability to learn is not only changeable and limitless but also that the growth is measurable.

                I’ve actually been engaging with this idea a lot in the past year in regards to living with depression. I’ve learnt to treat mental illnesses in the same way as a physical injury as they physically change the structure of our brain and its neuropathways. By understanding that our brains networks are tangible and not fixed we can create neuropathways that are healthy and work around damaged areas of the brain. To aide in conceptualising this idea of the maluable brain; take the example of people who have undergone severe brain trauma like a gunshot wound. There are cases of victims brains who after years of TBI treatment have completely switched the hemisphere their brain is/was most active In, to “work around” the damaged area. Through the power of thought, belief and perseverance we can completely restructure our physical brain and in turn how we think and learn.

              <em>
                Practices like mindfulness are great for increasing neuroplasticity and strengthening neuropathways. Also cognitive exercise like reading which could help improve lateral thought.

                A growth mindset is basically a mode of consciousness or way of living which enables us to believe that we are capable of understanding and taking in new information, as opposed to believing our ability to learn is capped or finite.

                I actually just found it really validating and empowering. It wasn’t so much learning new information as it was reinforcing and gaining a better insight into something I had already been quite interested in.

                I find this app called headspace is super helpful for me in fully realising or tuning into the mindset I need for learning. It’s just guided mindfulness but it really helps encourage that growth mindset and drown out any negative or limiting thoughts.
