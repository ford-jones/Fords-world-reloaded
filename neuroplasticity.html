                If we understand the principles of neuroplasticity we can then understand our brain’s as maluable objects. Our brains physical structure changes as we learn, think and conceptualise new ideas. Learning about neuroplasticity can teach people that their ability to learn is not only changeable and limitless but also that the growth is measurable.

                I’ve actually been engaging with this idea a lot in the past year in regards to living with depression. I’ve learnt to treat mental illnesses in the same way as a physical injury as they physically change the structure of our brain and its neuropathways. By understanding that our brains networks are tangible and not fixed we can create neuropathways that are healthy and work around damaged areas of the brain. To aide in conceptualising this idea of the maluable brain; take the example of people who have undergone severe brain trauma like a gunshot wound. There are cases of victims brains who after years of TBI treatment have completely switched the hemisphere their brain is/was most active In, to “work around” the damaged area. Through the power of thought, belief and perseverance we can completely restructure our physical brain and in turn how we think and learn.

              <em>
                Practices like mindfulness are great for increasing neuroplasticity and strengthening neuropathways. Also cognitive exercise like reading which could help improve lateral thought.
