          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?

          <em>
          All these traits come together like Voltron to form an emotionally rounded and intellegent person. Emotional intelligence is important in a learning environment to be able to understand others, listen attentively and help others in a kind, safe and supportive way.

          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
          Before I started studying here I was told by some DEV alumni that the course was core-heavy. I think it took me by surprise realising that so many people in the tech industry really don’t have much practice in those skills. The fact that they are being taught in a tech institution is really cool and quite promising for other industries too. I think all institutions should do this.

          What we the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
          I think just letting go of your preconceived ideas or ways of navigating the world and moulding yourself into a more communally mindful environment is quite challenging and different for me. I’m an only child and have never been much of a team player. For instance mindfulness for me has always been a very inward practice, so flipping that around into an outward practice is quite new and difficult for me.

        <span class="question">
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            I guess because so many people who have gotten / get into tech up until present day have all been kind of socially defunct shut-ins. I’m making a huge generalisation there but the stereotype exists for a reason! Computer lurkers generally speaking are kind of Incel-ish so we need to change that culture if we are heading towards a future where tech is embedded into all of our daily lives.

        <span class="question">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </span>
        <p class="response">
          <em>
            No I don’t think its a waste of time. I think the way that you have to practice core here is somewhat different to anything else. Coding is basically creating puzzles and solving them. The difference between a piece of code and a crossword is that to get something working you HAVE to finish the piece of code. If you get stuck doing a crossword or it starts to wear on your nerves, there is nothing holding you to finish it and sit through hours of frustration. It’s also really useful to have moments or days during the coursework where you focus on something other than problem solving. Writing and reflecting is a great way to get the brain and fingers moving.
